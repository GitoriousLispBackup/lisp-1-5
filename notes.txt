Self modifying code (supported by instruction set too)
  ex.: storing the saved registers as immediate values in the
       restore instructions (non re-entrant, but ok for non recursive).


They liked to use similar looking letters a lot QO0, I1 included in
similar looking labels: STO/STQ, EVI1/EV11, etc.




One notes also the early style, where label names are taken  randomly
from girlfriend first names or musical instrument names, instead of a
more systematic or automatic naming scheme...


Index registers can hold addresses.
AC and MQ can hold each a cons (full word), both with its car and cdr.

Hence, in the comments:

   CAR(L) and CDR(L) denote the addresses of the car and cdr, 
                     the ones found in the cons L.

   CWR(CAR(L)) == (CL:CAR L)
   CWR(CDR(L)) == (CL:CDR L)


(ZEROP n) tests fixnum: n = 0 or float: (<= (- FLOTOL) n FLOTOL) !
